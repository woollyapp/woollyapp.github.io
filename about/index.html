          <h2>Why did you make this ?</h2>
          <p>I've always been a big fan of <a href="http://www.sequelpro.com">Sequel Pro</a>, and I found it incredibly useful for browsing data.</p>
          <p>The last company I worked for was a MySQL shop and Sequel Pro was a life saver.  After I left that job, I looked around to see what had been brewing while I was working buried in depths of Rails + MySQL + Redis</p>
          <p>2 things really caught my eye.  First Heroku as a platform was now totally mainstream and a lot of my friends were building everything on Heroku.  Second that on Heroku (and many other places) Postgres was the new and upcoming defacto database of choice</p>
          <p>I looked around for something that would fill the void that Sequel Pro did on MySQL.  There were a few free things that didn't quite do it (some crashed a lot, no naming names) and I'll be honest, I could never get myself to use the navigational feline one.  Sequel Pro had set a high bar, and I needed something that followed that on certain dimensions but could drop the ball on other dimensions.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <h2>What is your goal ?</h2>
          <p>To be honest, I was just scratching my own itch, however I then found out it was an itch a lot of my developer friends had too.  We all built web apps, we all used Heroku and therefore Postgres and we were all MySQL + Sequel Pro refugees.</p>
          <p>The use case is pretty specific, none of us are DBAs, we don't want to spend time doing tuning, configs, backups or any of the things that really Heroku should be doing.</p>
          <p>Heroku made configuration and hosting a thing that devs no longer really need to think about, at least not until much later in the game when you can pay someone to solve that for you.</p>
          <p>So my goal is to get a feature set that let's me build my web apps faster.  There is no administrative features, every DBA I have ever known always does that stuff on the command-line her own way so there is little value in making an interface for that.  For the most part I need to see my table structure, maybe look at my test database and figure out why my tests are failing or just browse the data looking for the pattern of a bug in the app.</p>
          <p>If you are looking for something more powerful, there are a lot of better alternatives out there.  I just discovered one in the App Store that looks pretty awesome, but definitely over kill for my small use case. (our release timing is shockingly close, but having built this, I know it took months to build so it really is a coincidence since there is no way that either of us could have copied the other)</p>

        <div class="col-lg-8">
          <h2>Will you ever add feature X ?</h2>
          <p>If it's a feature that would make the way I build web apps faster, then I would say probably yes.  Keep in mind this isn't my day job, and it's a means to an end.  I like building apps quickly on Heroku, and I want to keep doing that.</p>
